**Terminal-Rich-Presence** is a simple Python script that integrates your terminal activity with Discord Rich Presence. 
It updates your Discord status when `iTerm2` is running, displaying details like the shell in use and the duration of the session.

### Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- `psutil` (`pip install psutil`)
- `pypresence` (`pip install pypresence`)
